	<p>As noted above, my name is Marissa. I am from Portsmouth, NH,

		a lovely and quaint towm along a portion of New Hampshire's 18 miles of seacoast.

		Following adolescence, I headed off to Poughkeepsie, NY to

		attend Vassar College where I played lacrosse, ran the hip hop club

		and explored the likes of Matthew Barney. It was a quintessential

		liberal arts experience. Following graduation, I moved to Oakland,

		CA to pursue dreams of planning. I eventually got a job at the planning

		and design firm, MIG where I was a project associate for four years.

		Outside of my job, I spent most time biking up and down chaparral hills

		and gallivanting under the California sun. And now I go to MIT.
